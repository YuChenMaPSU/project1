## project1

This part of the project went realtively smoothly I was able to download and read all the data the is needed for the project. Other than downloading the data I made some adjustments with the data such as removing some unneeded data and also change some of the title of columns.

The goals I have for the furture might be to create some of the plots that I will be using. Also looking into some different ways for me to determine whether a planet candidate is ready for publication.
